This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. The project involves creating a machine learning model using scikit-learn, setting up a Flask server to handle HTTP requests, and developing a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The objective is to build a web application to predict real estate prices based on various input features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

Approach-
1) Model Building:
Use the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.
Clean and preprocess the data.
Use linear regression and other models to build the prediction model.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
2) Backend Development:
Create a Python Flask server.
Load the trained model.
Handle HTTP requests to predict home prices based on user inputs.
3) Frontend Development:
Build a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Collect input from the user (square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.).
Send the input data to the Flask server and display the predicted price.
Technologies Used-
Python
Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
Matplotlib for data visualization
Scikit-learn for model building
Flask for backend server
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend
Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
